1.0.0~dev6+intevation.1.2
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

* Bots:

  - Parser - ShadowServer

    For the Open-LDAP feed `dns_host_name' is now mapped to
    `source.local_hostname' instead of `destination.local_hostname'.


NEW FEATURES

* Bots:

  - Collector - Generic Mail URL Fetcher
    Collector - Generic URL Fetcher

    Bots do no longer hang, if the download connection does not terminate.

  - Parser - ShadowServer

    Improved Logging: non DHO fields are only reported on log level
    "DEBUG" (no longer on "INFO") and warnings are generated if the
    shadow server format changes.

  - Expert - Modify

    Evaluation order of the Rules is now deterministic


UPGRADE

* from 1.0.0~dev4+intevation.1.2~beta4testbuild20160930133128
  (upgrade from older Versions is untested)

  For generic upgrade instructions see below.


  Dependencies:

  If you are using intelmq-mailgen, note that you will need at least
  version 0.95~beta3 or later.


  Configuration:

  The startup.conf was deprecated in this release, it is substituted
  by integrating the information into runtime.conf.  To migrate to the
  unified runtime.conf:

    # Run intelmqctl once, this will automatically generate a file
    # runtime.conf.new: 
    su - intelmq -c 'intelmqctl status'
    # Move the old configuration out of the way and use the new file:
    mv /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf.OLD_WITH_STARTUP_CONF
    mv /opt/intelmq/etc/startup.conf /opt/intelmq/etc/startup.conf.OLD
    mv /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf.new /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf

  The system.conf is deprecated.  The information is now stored in
  defaults.conf.  Merge your settings from
  `/opt/intelmq/etc/system.conf' into `/opt/intelmq/etc/defaults.conf',
  then delete `/opt/intelmq/etc/system.conf'.

  
  Bot Specific:

  - Collector - Generic Mail URL Fetcher
    Collector - Generic URL Fetcher

    The configuration parameter `http_ssl_proxy' was renamed to
    `https_proxy', you can update your existing configuration bu a
    simple search and replace:

      sed -i 's/http_ssl_proxy/https_proxy/' /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf

  - Parser - ShadowServer

    `override' is deprecated, it is now called `overwrite':

      sed -i 's/override/overwrite/' /opt/intelmq/etc/runtime.conf

    If you are using the OpenLDAP feed in combination with a db output
    you might want to fix your existing data to reflect the new
    mapping of `dns_host_name' (see BUG FIXES above).  To do so, you
    can use the following SQL statement on you events-database:

      UPDATE events
         SET "source.local_hostname"="destination.local_hostname",
             "destination.local_hostname"=DEFAULT
       WHERE "feed.name"='Open-LDAP' AND "source.local_hostname" IS NULL;

    The semantics of the configuration have slightly changed, see:
    https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/pull/745
    the configuration is supposed to be backwards compatible, never
    the less you should verify, that the results are still like
    expected.

  - Outputs - PostgreSQL

    A new field was added to the events description.  To reflect this
    in an existing database, add the field as db admin on the database
    server:

      su - postgres
      psql intelmq-events -c 'ALTER TABLE events ADD "feed.provider" text;'
      exit



Generic Upgrade Instructions
----------------------------

All steps are executed as root user, unless stated otherise.

Before upgrading intelmq should be stopped:

  su - intelmq -c 'intelmqctl stop'

NOTE: If there are still events in the queue they will be processed
  after restarting IntelMQ with the new bots from the upgrade.  In
  some rare cases this might lead to unwanted behavior.  To prevent
  this its best to first stop all collector bots and wait for the
  queues to empty before stopping the rest oft IntelMQ.

when running the IntelMQ Manager stopping the web server should be
considered, too:

  service apache2 stop

Then upgrade to the latest packages, either using dpkg or `apt
upgrade'.  Follow the release specific upgrade notes above, the start
IntelMQ again:

  su - intelmq -c 'intelmqctl start'

If you stopped the web server, restart it, too:

  service apache2 start
