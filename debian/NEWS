intelmq (1.0.0~dev4+intevation.1.2~beta3) experimental; urgency=low

  The events database has to be reinitialized because its schema has changed.
  This was necessary to remove restrictions on the length of "raw" fields.

  This package now includes the documentation of all bots.
  Previously-packaged docs and examples have been moved to the new standard
  location: /usr/share/doc/intelmq/bots.

  Specifically, the certbund_contact docs and the modify bot examples have
  been moved there.

intelmq (1.0.0~dev4+intevation.1.2~alpha1) experimental; urgency=low

  The individual Shadowserver parser bots have been replaced with a single
  bot, so existing configurations may need to be updated.
